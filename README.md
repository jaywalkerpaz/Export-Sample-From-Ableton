EXPORT AUDIO FROM ABLETON

Description: These scripts automate sample exporting, collecting, and processing to quickly resample sounds and build sample libraries. These scripts work most effectively when tied to specific hotkeys or macros, working towards a one-button automated solution.

How it works
- exportAudio.py grabs the latest file recorded, removes silence, renames, and stores a temp version of the sample as well as an optional stored version.
- exportAudio2.py is a drag-and-drop script designed to get a file from Finder and drop it back into a specific drum rack in Abeton.
- This process can be repeated for further resampling of the same audio file.
